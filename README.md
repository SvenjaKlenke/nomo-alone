# NoMo Alone

My project is aimed at institutions where people live who have no people to take care of them.
With this program, residents can make appointments and ask for someone to accompany them
when they go shopping or when they go to the doctor or the authorities

## Prerequisites

Before running this program, make sure you have completed the following steps:

1. Open MongoDB Compass on your machine and create a new database.

- Click on the "New Connection" button.
- Enter the necessary connection details (`mongodb://localhost:27017/`).
- Click "Connect" to establish a connection.
- Click "Create Database" and choose the name for the database ( `NomoDB`).
- Click "Create Collection" and choose the name for the collection (`Tasks`)
- Click "Add Data" and choose "Import JSON oder CSV file"
- Use the file backend/src/test/resources/nomoDB_tasks.json
